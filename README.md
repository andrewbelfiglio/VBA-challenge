# VBA-challenge

# This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

# The VBA file in this repo loops through generated stock market data to create a summary table of yearly change, percent change, and total volume of the stock.

# It will also report the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total stock volume for each year/sheet.

# This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program. 

# The code to loop through all worksheets of the workbook was created by merging two suggested solutions from online users.

# The "For i=1 to ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets.count" line of code was suggested by Patrick Lepelletier https://stackoverflow.com/users/2900158/patrick-lepelletier

# I combined this with the "Worksheets().Select" function suggested by jcarlosd https://www.mrexcel.com/board/members/jcarlosd.11569/
